ðŸ“Š End-to-End Data Analytics Project (Python + Snowflake + SQL)
This project showcases a complete data analytics workflow using Python, Snowflake, and SQL:

1. Data Preprocessing with Python

* A large JSON dataset was split into smaller chunks using Python to optimize and speed up data ingestion.

2. Cloud Storage & Loading

* The processed files were uploaded to AWS S3, and then ingested into Snowflake for analysis.

3. Data Analysis with SQL

* Leveraging SQL within Snowflake, I answered a series of insightful business questions through analytical queries.
